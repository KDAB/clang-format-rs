# clang-format-rs

A basic clang-format Rust wrapper.

This allows for formatting a given input using `clang-format` from the system.
By default it uses `clang-format` binary but this can be changed by setting the
`CLANG_FORMAT_BINARY` environment variable, for example,
`CLANG_FORMAT_BINARY=clang-format-16`

```rust
use clang_format::{clang_format, ClangFormatStyle, CLANG_FORMAT_STYLE};

fn main() {
    CLANG_FORMAT_STYLE.set(ClangFormatStyle::Mozilla);

    let input = r#"
        struct Test {

        };
    "#;
    let output = clang_format(input);
    assert!(output.is_ok());
    assert_eq!(output.unwrap(), "\nstruct Test\n{};\n");
}
```

# Tests

The test suite can be executed using the `tests.sh` script.

```bash
./tests.sh
```
